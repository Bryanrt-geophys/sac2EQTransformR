# sac2EQTransformR
sac2EQTransformR is an R based program written to work in tandem with [EQTransformer](https://github.com/smousavi05/EQTransformer), [mseed2sac](https://github.com/iris-edu/mseed2sac), and by-hand methods of picking phase arrivals in earthquake siesmic traces that store charecterizations in .dat file formats. sac2EQTransformR is being created for the purpose of using previosuly located signals and queried continous trace data to create hdf5 and csv files that can be passed to EQTransformer to generate training models. The goal is to provide an easy method for those using the by-hand approach to transition to a deep-learning driven approach.
